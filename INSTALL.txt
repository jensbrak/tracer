Installation Instructions
=========================

The program is not very advanced so there's really not much to it.

The makefile in the ./src directory should explain it well enough.
Just type

  make help

for rules available. In short, the following steps has to be taken:

1) Edit the file ./src/Makefile to suit your needs. This should at the
most include editing the BASEDIR and BINDIR variables.

2) For a byte code version type

  make bc

This creates a byte code version of the ray tracer in the ./src
directory. Or, for a native code version type

  make nc

and a machine dependant (see the Ocaml distribution for supported
platforms) and faster version of the ray tracer will be created in the
./src directory. 

3) To install the tracer (right now this involves just copying the
latest produced binary to the specified (see BINDIR in ./src/Makefile)
directory.

Enjoy!
