Description File Syntax
=======================

The syntax of the description files used is a modified subset of the
PovRay format.

The ways to express grammars in pure text files is quite
limited. Terminals are in lowercase, Brackets [ ] denotes optional rules and
/epsilon/ denotes the epsilon rule. The following characters are
terminals as well:   , { } < >

Grammar
-------

SPECS		--> SPEC SPECS 
		 |  /epsilon/
SPEC		--> CAMERA
 		 |  OBJECT
 		 |  BACKGROUND
CAMERA		--> camera { location VECTOR sky VECTOR look_at VECTOR }
OBJECT		--> SPHERE 
		 |  PLANE  
	         |  TRIANGLE
 		 |  LIGHT	
SPHERE		--> sphere { VECTOR, NUMBER [sphere_orient] object_mods }
SPHERE_ORIENT	--> pole VECTOR equator VECTOR
PLANE		--> plane { VECTOR, NUMBER OBJECT_MODS }
PLANE		--> plane_point { VECTOR, VECTOR OBJECT_MODS }
TRIANGLE	--> triangle { VECTOR, VECTOR, VECTOR OBJECT_MODS }
TRIANGLE	--> triangle_point { VECTOR, VECTOR, VECTOR OBJECT_MODS }
PARALLELOGRAM	--> parallelogram { VECTOR, VECTOR, VECTOR OBJECT_MODS }
PARALLELOGRAM	--> parallelogram_point { VECTOR, VECTOR, VECTOR OBJECT_MODS }
LIGHT		--> light_source { VECTOR }
BACKGROUND	--> background { COLOR }
OBJECT_MODS	--> [pigment] [finish]
PIGMENT		--> pigment { PIGSPEC }
PIGSPEC		--> COLOR
		 |  IMAGE
FINISH		--> finish { [diffuse NUMBER] [reflection NUMBER] }
COLOR		--> color rgb VECTOR
		 |  color red NUMBER green NUMBER blue NUMBER
IMAGE		--> image_map { ppm NAME }
VECTOR		--> < number, number, number >
NAME		--> "string"
NUMBER		--> integer | float


Comments:

* The normal of a plane doesn't have to be normalized when read from
the description file.

* Pole- and equator vectors for spheres are only needed if textures
is projected in the sphere. This is not PovRay grammar (it is done
through rotations of the object and the texture instead)

* A camera has to be included. If several cameras are defined, the
latest occurrence is used.

* A plane expressed with the plane rule describes a plane with its
normal and distance from origo along the normal.

* A plane expressed with the plane_point rule describes a plane with
one point at the plane and its normal. Not PovRay syntax.

* A triangle expressed with the triangle rule describes the corners of
a triangle in absolute coordinates.

* A triangle expressed with the triangle_point rule describes a
triangle with one corner in absolute coordinates and the two others
relative to the first. Not PovRay syntax.

* A parallelogram is almost identical as a triangle, it has only one
more corner (A parallelogram is two identical triangles, one mirrored
against the other). Parallelogram does not exist in PovRay.

* Order between statements not entirely arbritrary (PovRay allows this)

* If any value of the objects is ignored, the following defaults are
used:

  - background	<0, 0, 0>
  - pole	<0, 1, 0>
  - equator	<1, 0, 0>
  - finish	reflection 0, diffuse 1
  - pigment	color rgb <0.5, 0.5, 0.5>
